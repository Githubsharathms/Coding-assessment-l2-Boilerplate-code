The webpage features a bold and clear section titled "SELECT YOUR CHOICE," which serves as a category selector for the products displayed below. This selector has three options: Men, Women, and Kids, each represented by a button. The 'Men' button is highlighted, suggesting that the current selection is for men's clothing.
Below the category selector, there are four products displayed side by side, each within its own card-like container. These containers have a clean and modern design, with a subtle shadow that gives the impression of depth, suggesting these are clickable elements.
Each product card includes:
1. A prominent product image that is well-lit and professionally presented, showcasing the clothing item clearly.
2. A label or badge indicating a special feature or offer associated with the product, such as "Wedding Special," "On offer," or "New season."
3. The product name and brand (e.g., "Mens Kurta • Manyvar" and "RCB Tshirt • Puma").
4. The pricing information, with the current price prominently displayed and the original price crossed out, alongside a percentage discount, indicating the savings available.
The product cards are evenly spaced and arranged in a grid layout, which allows for easy browsing.
Overall, the webpage's layout is strategically organized to facilitate a pleasant shopping experience.
